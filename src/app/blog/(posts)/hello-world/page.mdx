# Hello World

Hi I'm Umar Farooqi, welcome to my blog

I wanted to try out some newer technologies so decided to rebuild my old un-loved personal website using Next.js.
Could probably have used Vite instead (which I'll be trying on some other projects) but noticed Next.js has nice ways of
integrating Markdown-based blog posts into your site so thought I'd try that too.

At my job we have our own component library based on styled-components so have been very used to that. Thought I'd try
out Tailwind as that seems to be hyped up. I also went through a load of different component libraries but always found
them a bit too inflexible, requiring lots of config that seems to conflict with other things. That's when I discovered
the concept of headless UI component libraries. So I've been using shadcn and loving it so far.
