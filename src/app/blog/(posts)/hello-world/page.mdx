# Hello World

Hi I'm Umar Farooqi, welcome to my blog.


I bought this domain about 7 years ago and just put up a very basic page with a game of Snake built in JS. After a
year and a half working in a web development team I decided to rebuild my personal website using Next.js. I
considered using something like Vite as this isn't a big project that's being served to loads of clients and
requires optimised SEO, etc.

I work a lot with existing Next.js 12 projects so am relatively comfortable with it but
I'd never created a Next.js project from scratch. I also wanted to learn the new features included in Next.js 14 and
see what it's like using the App Router.


I used TypeScript for this project as a way to get more comfortable with it (and because IMO it should basically be the
default unless you have some case where JS is more suited). At my job a lot of stuff is still in JS so I haven't
developed the fluency with TS that comes from using it every day. I am part of a group of devs there who are pushing
to migrate our JS repos to TS (among other tech improvements to bring us in line with the rest of the industry) but
for now I'm using this as a way to learn it more deeply.


For the styling I thought I'd try out Tailwind as it's widely used now and I didn't have any experience with it.
I've mainly worked with styled-components as that's what I use at my job - I quite like it for using dynamic styling
and not having to worry about having a million different stylesheets like before when I used SASS.

Going to Tailwind feels like an in-between where I can have my components and its styles viewable in one place but
avoid the bloatedness that comes with CSS-in-JS solutions. I can't say I really enjoy looking at the massive
classNames that seem to now be everywhere in the code but I am finding it quite quick for prototyping and just
getting styles done.


I've also tried a fair few different component libraries. At my job we have our own component library based on
styled-components so have been very used to that. Obviously I can't use that here so I gave a few different ones a
try (as you see in the mess that is the commit history) - Material UI, Chakra, Mantine, etc. I kept getting annoyed
at them for one reason or another. They were either too inflexible for custom styling, had convoluted methods for
implementing certain things like dark mode, or straight up conflicted/didn't work nicely with Next.js. Some of
that is probably me being inexperienced and impatient so I thought I'd pick one and deal with the issues.


However, I did some more reading and discovered the concept of headless UI component libraries. I can take the
implementation of the components' logic and then do what I want with their presentation (and modify the logic if I
ever need to). Does mean I have to do more work to ensure a consistent design language across the components but
this project is mostly for my own learning so I'm fine with that. I've been using [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com)
and am loving it so far!
