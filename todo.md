# To Do

- implement scroll hijacking thing with fullPage.js (parallax extension maybe) - make sure it works with Next & React tho
- scroll down to next section should have a selection of images to look through

- do i need node/express on the back?
- navbar
- portfolio/about me
- projects? lol wat
- music?
- contact details



# Done
- how to change background, accents, etc globally
  - use input.css & that npx tailwind blah blah command to generate the output
- dark mode rendering differently on client vs server
- where do you put ThemeProviders in a NextJS project? - just bodge it in the layout.tsx apparently
- use styled-components or tailwind instead of this css shite
- add a component library - ~~probs MUI~~ -went with Chakra instead- ACTUALLY WE GOING with shadcn now
